# Java_CSCI_3920
Assignment from Java Course in University of Colorado Denver.

#How to use
Write 5 different OS commands in a text editor and save each individual command as dummyBatch[OS command number].bat 
in the same directory as the driver.java file. For example: the first OS Command you want to execute should be written in 
a text editor and saved as dummyBatch1.bat and the second command should be saved as dummyBatch2.bat and etc. 

This program creates 5 threads, each executing a different batch file.
Note: These commands only work for Windows Operating Systems.

#Note
The specific commands for the assignment is explained in the driver.java file. The batch files for those commands aren't included
in the repository.
